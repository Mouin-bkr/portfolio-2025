  bio: `I’m a computer science student passionate about building interactive and intelligent web applications.
My journey started with frontend development — crafting clean interfaces and responsive designs — but what excites me now is adding real logic and intelligence behind them.
I enjoy experimenting with APIs, automation, and AI-powered features that make apps more dynamic and meaningful.
I’m currently exploring projects that mix creativity with problem-solving — combining design thinking with technical depth.`,
